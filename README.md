# microbit-uart

Utility library to implement async UART communication on the micro:bit.

Currently only supports the micro:bit V2.

Code for synchronous behaviour is mostly taken from
the [nrf-rs/microbit crate examples](https://github.com/nrf-rs/microbit/tree/main/examples/serial-hal-blocking-echo).
